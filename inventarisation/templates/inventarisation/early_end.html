    Reached end for inventarisation for  {{ inventarisation.location }}. This was reached before all items were inventarised.<br />
    There are two options, either continue the inventarisation, or finish it as it is. If you finish it as it is, any books that were not entered will be skipped for this inventarisation. This has no <i>disastrous</i> consequences, but is nevertheless generally not wanted.<br>
        <a class="btn btn-primary"  href="{% url 'inventarisation.next' inventarisation.pk  -1  %}">Continue</a>
    <a class="btn btn-primary" href="{% url 'inventarisation.finished' inventarisation.pk   %}">Finish it</a>
