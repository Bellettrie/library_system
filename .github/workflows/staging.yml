name: Deploy staging

# We deploy staging if the develop branch is updated, by creating a new tag, or by hand through the Github Actions (using workflow_dispatch).
# Observe that updating staging means resetting the database to a recent backup of the production database.
# This means that there's no issues with testing migrations on a very recent production DB.
