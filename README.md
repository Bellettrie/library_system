# Bellettrie System

This project (BS) contains the website / Library Management System of Bellettrie. BS uses Django as a web framework, and bootstrap for constructing pages. Other than that, it is light on dependencies, to lower the amount of dependency update hell.

## Setup of development environment
1. Download project from Git.
2. Install recent python version (3.10 or higher)
3. run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the root of the project. You may want to look into virtual environments.
4. Install docker-desktop (or docker + docker-compose).
5. Start up docker-desktop/your docker server
6. get a dev database, and add this one to the docker_local folder as `startup.sql`. <br> 
If you are a member of Bellettrie, and are a member of the web committee you can download a dev database dump from [here](https://bellettrie.utwente.nl/dev/). Note that if you are not a member of said committee, you may end up in a redirect loop, since you lack permissions to download the files.
7. Run `docker-compose up` in the docker_local folder. 
8. Run `python manage.py migrate` for good measure
9. Run `python manage.py runserver`.

## Linting
The CI environment uses Flake8 for linting. The following command may work within pycharm, if you have flake8 installed (install the requirements again if you don't, it's one of the requirements now).
```bash
flake8 . --ignore F401,E501,W503 --count --show-source --statistics --max-line-length=127 --exclude venv,jstoolchain/node_modules
```


## Using Tailwind
Install npm (or yarn if you know how), and install the dependencies in the /styles/static folder. Use `npm ci`



Enter the /styles/config folder and run the following command for local dev:
`npm run watch`

Run `npm compile` to merely compile 


Note that tailwind's tooling reads the source of all our templates to see which tags are actually in use. 
A *todo* here is to figure out how to hae it load single file components correctly.
